## `if` statement fun

```{r}

burrito <- 2.4

if (burrito > 2) {
  print("I love burritos!")
}

# using if statements to create an output based on a variable

```

Creating a vector with strings

```{r}

my_ships <- c("Millenium Falcon", "X-wing", "Tie-Fighter", "Death Star")

str_detect(my_ships, pattern = "r")
# going through each element in the vector and if it contains "r" in the character - looking for any string match that exists in the vector

str_detect(my_ships, pattern = "x")
# case sensitive - can see that X-wing is not showing up as true since it is upper

starwars

```

```{r}

tatooine_characters <- starwars |> 
  filter(homeworld == "Tatooine")
# for each row check the condition if the homeworld value is equal to Tatooine then keep it, if not true don't keep it. Under the hood it is doing a if else (if Tatooine is true keep, if not remove the world)


# Using the in operator to check for multiple possible matches, the in operator asks a different option is that if any of these options are true then keep the row

tatooine_endor_naboo <- starwars |> 
  filter(homeworld %in% c("Tatooine", "Naboo", "Endor"))

# could write out long ways with using | the or operator and you would get the case if any of them are true -
# the in operator creates a shortcut for or statements - does the value of homeworld contatin a value that is in the following vector

# valuable for keep code concise, if you have an exisiting vector you could also plug that in

# string r string detect - does this pattern contain anywhere in this element, if it is yes returns TRUE

str_detect(my_ships, pattern = "x")

phrase <- "I love burritos!"

if (str_detect(phrase, "love")) {
  print("I am a burrito fan.")
}

# could use string detect to print out patterns and not doing an if el statement

```


## Example of the `%in%` operator

```{r}



```


## `if-else` statement using

```{r}

pika <- 89.1

if (pika > 60) {
  print ("mega pika")
} else ("normal pika")


# all of programming is if this is true do this or if false do this
```


## if else if else

```{r}

marmot <- 2.8

if (marmot < 0.5) {
  print ("this is a small marmot")} else if (marmot >= 0.5 & marmot <3) {
    print ("this is a medium marmot")} else
  {
    print("this is a large marmot")
  }


```
